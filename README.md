*Companion-Input-Output*

The scope of this project is to create a system that can integrate onto a raspberry pi, and recognize the user's speech, store it as a python variable, and repeat the user's speech back to the user. The system will also be able to recognize the user's speech and perform a specific action based on the user's speech. 

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git`

2. Create and activate a virtual environment in CLI (Unix)):

```
$ pip install virtualenv
$ python3.10 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the project, try the following:
